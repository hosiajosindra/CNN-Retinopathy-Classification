# CNN-Retinopathy-Classification
<p align="justify">
 Detecting Retinopathy of Prematurity Disease in Premature Baby Based on Fundus Image Data with CNN Model using VGG19's Architecture.
</p>

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Objective
<p align="justify">
The purpose of this project is to explain how the Convolutional Neural Network method works in detecting Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in premature babies, knowing the effect of data augmentation on the model in the application of cases of detection of Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in premature infants, and analyzing the performance of the model without data augmentation and with data augmentation to get the best model for the application of Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) detection cases in premature infants.

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
