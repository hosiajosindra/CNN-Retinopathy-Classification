# CNN-Retinopathy-Classification
<p align="justify">
 Detecting Retinopathy of Prematurity Disease in Premature Baby Based on Fundus Image Data with CNN Model using VGG19's Architecture.
</p>

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Objective
<p align="justify">
The purpose of this project is to explain how the Convolutional Neural Network method works in detecting Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in premature babies, knowing the effect of data augmentation on the model in the application of cases of detection of Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in premature infants, and analyzing the performance of the model without data augmentation and with data augmentation to get the best model for the application of Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) detection cases in premature infants.
